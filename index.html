  <h2>About me</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>I was born and raised in San Leandro CA in the East Bay.
    I’m an incoming senior at San Leandro High School and for the four years I’ve been there I have been apart of the swim team.
    I’m the president of Key Club which is the oldest, largest, non-profit student led organization in the world.
    I enjoy hanging out with friends, eating, and sleeping.
    I don’t like getting my fingers dirty so I often eat finger food with forks or chopsticks.
    A fun fact about me is that I can only swim butterfly and the 3 other strokes are much harder for me which is pretty ironic.</h3>

  <h2>Coding Experience</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    Growing up I didn’t spend much time on the internet because I wasn’t allowed to so naturally I just said I wanted to be a pediatrician when I grew up.
    I took biology and then AP biology and realized I wasn’t good at that and decided to take AP Computer Science my junior year.
    Although I wasn’t the best coder because I went into an AP with no experience, I enjoyed the class a lot.
    That’s when I got inspired to pursue computer science as my major in college. Let’s hope it works out…</h3>

  <h2>Extracurricular Life</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    I mentioned a bit about what I do outside of school but let’s go more in depth shall we.
    So basically I’ve been swimming since I was 5 years old.
    I learned how to swim before I was taught how to “properly” run so basically I can’t run to save my life but I can swim to save my life.
    Water was basically my escape because being an introvert, human contact was a big no.
    It helped me relax and clear my head especially once I joined the high school team.
    It was so much more rigorous than I was use to that I had no time to think about other things that were stressing me out earlier in the day.
    Basically swim is my escape from reality.</h3>

  <h2>Key Club</h2>
  </div>
  <h3>
    Key Club is the oldest, largest, most successful, non-profit student led organization in the world.
    It’s a community service club that allows you to meet so many people because we all have one common goal and that is to make the world a better place.
    I’ve done a total of 300+ service hours in the past 3 years I’ve been in the club and held 3 officer position.
    My second year I served as the division Executive Assistant, third year I served as my club Vice President
    (and got Distinguished VP out of every other VP in California, Nevada, and Hawaii plus Vice President of the Year from my division),
    and going into my fourth year I proudly serve San Leandro Key Club as their president.
    Entering high school I was a shy person but Key Club allowed me to come out of my shell and become a more sociable person.
